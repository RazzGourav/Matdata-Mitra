   - A Node.js/Express server that handles registration, facial recognition integration, blockchain interaction, and queue management.
3. **Blockchain Layer:**
   - Ethereum smart contracts store voter data securely. Transactions are signed using a private key.
4. **Decentralized Storage:**
   - IPFS is used for storing documents and metadata in a decentralized manner.
5. **Facial Recognition Service:**
   - A Python microservice or integrated module that processes camera input to detect and verify voter faces.
6. **NFC Integration:**
   - Modules that generate and validate NFC tokens during various voter interactions.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.8–3.12; ensure dependencies for face recognition are satisfied)
- **MongoDB:** Install locally or use a cloud-hosted instance.
- **Ganache:** For running a local Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS:** Either run a local IPFS node or use a pinning service.
- **Optional:** Docker for containerized deployment.

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matdata-mitra.git
   cd matdata-mitra/backend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with contents similar to:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/blockchain-voter-id
   ETH_PROVIDER_URL=http://localhost:8545
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContractAddress
   PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourGanachePrivateKey
   IPFS_HOST=localhost
   IPFS_PORT=5001
   IPFS_PROTOCOL=http
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts:**

   Use Truffle (or Hardhat) to compile and deploy your smart contracts to Ganache. Update the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable in your `.env` file with the deployed contract’s address.

5. **Start the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. **Install React Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContractAddress
   REACT_APP_INFURA_ID=your-infura-project-id  # if used for blockchain connectivity
   ```

4. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Python Facial Recognition Module Setup

1. **Navigate to the Python Module Directory (if separate):**

   ```bash
   cd ../face_voting
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv face_env
   source face_env/bin/activate   # On Windows: face_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Registration and Recognition Scripts:**

   - **Register a Face:**
     ```bash
     python registration.py
     ```
   - **Run Recognition:**
     ```bash
     python recognition.py
     ```

## Usage

### Voter Registration

- **Step 1:**  
  A voter accesses the registration page on the frontend, fills in details, and uploads required documents (e.g., photo, address proof).
- **Step 2:**  
  The backend processes the form:
  - Files are uploaded to IPFS.
  - Voter details are stored on the blockchain and MongoDB.
  - A QR code is generated containing the voter ID and IPFS hash.
- **Step 3:**  
  The QR code is displayed to the user, which can later be used for verification.

### Voter Verification

- **QR Code Scanning:**  
  Use the integrated QR scanner (or a mobile app) to scan the voter’s QR code.
- **Verification Process:**  
  The frontend sends the scanned voter ID to the backend, which:
  - Retrieves the voter record from MongoDB.
  - Optionally verifies the voter status on the blockchain.
  - Returns the voter information and a verification status.
- **Alert Mechanism:**  
  If a registered voter is detected multiple times (using facial recognition), the system triggers a red alert.

### Queue Management & NFC Token Generation

- **Queue Management:**  
  The system manages voter queues at polling stations, reducing wait times and ensuring orderly processing.
- **NFC Tokens:**  
  Secure NFC tokens are generated for interactions, enhancing both security and convenience during voting.
